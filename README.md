BYOD Captioning
===============
**This is the automatic version of the Bring Your Own Device captioning (where a show operator presses on button to start all the captions). If you are intrested in the manual version (where each user presses a button to start the captions), the repo can be found at https://github.com/SpaceVisualizationLaboratory/AdlerSubtitlesManual This repo holds the official 'release' version of the software. Jeffrey SubbaRao's development branch can be found here https://github.com/jsub1/AdlerSubtitles**

This project is designed to display subtitles at predeteremined intervals for BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) captioning. There is a JSON file that is an array of subtitles that have both a text and time properties. The script of the Adler Planetarium's Cosmic Wonder skyshow is provided as an example in CosmicWonder.json. Settings can be modified in the config.json file.

**Changes in V2.0:**  
Version 2 allows for a show operator to remotely start subtitles by pressing a button on a different webpage. This will cause the BYOD captions to start and sychronize with the operator's press.
  * Added 3 new files in the backend folder. The two php pages are the interface for the show operator. The txt file is the file that the client checks to deteremin if/when to start the subtitles. This file must be writable and the value of $fileName in start_subtitles.php must point to this file.
  * Added new config.json options
    * subtitleWindow: The number of time units that the window of synchronized subtitles will remain open.
    * statusFile: The file that determines if/when the subtitles start. This must be the same file specified in start_subtitles.php.
    * requestTimeout: The number of milliseconds between each time the client requests the statusFile.

config.json options:
  * textColor: Sets the color of the body text.
  * textSize: Sets the size of the body text.
  * backgroundColor: Sets the background color.
  * font: Sets the font family for the web page.
  * initalMessage: HTML to display between the time the button is pressed and the time the first subtitle appears.
  * initalDelay: The time to wait before the first subtitle appears. This setting is only used if relative timing is used (see absoluteTiming).
  * absoluteTiming: Boolean that determines if absolute or relative timing is used. If true, the time property of each subtitle is the time between the button being pressed and the subtitle appering (absolute timing). If false, the time property of each line is the duration of the line on the screen (relative timing).
  * tagSubtitles: An array with two strings. Each subtitle is inserted between the first and second string before being displayed.
  * msPerTimeUnit: The number of milliseconds per time unit used. The default vale is 1000 because the default time unit is seconds.
  * subtitleWindow: The number of time units that the window of synchronized subtitles will remain open.
  * statusFile: The file that determines if/when the subtitles start. This must be the same file specified in start_subtitles.php.
  * requestTimeout: The number of milliseconds between each time the client requests the statusFile.
