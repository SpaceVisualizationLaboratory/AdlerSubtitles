<h1>Cosmic Wonder Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Granger Sky Theater at the Adler Planetarium. I'm glad you were able to join us for today's presentation of Cosmic Wonder. </p>

<p>Did you get that penny when you entered the theater? Good. It is my gift to you - don't spend it all in one place. Seriously, though, hold on to it. We will use it during the show. And we hope you'll keep it as a souvenir to remember this experience.</p>

<p>Throughout time humans have engaged with the cosmos through an ongoing cycle of wonder, observation and discovery. It is a cyclical process that allows us to learn from the past, and push toward the frontiers of tomorrow.</p>

<p>We will explore the story of Cosmic Wonder, with some of the same software used by astronomers, the World Wide Telescope, developed by Microsoft Research. We will turn this theatre into a virtual observatory, one that can pull in and stitch together the best imagery from telescopes across the globe as well as in orbit above it.</p>
 
<p>Along with the most modern concepts we'll also explore historical ideas, assisted by images from the Adler's collections.</p>
